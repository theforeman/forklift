note as general
  This diagram outlines the design of all components and
  their interactions within the OpenShift/Kubernetes environment.
  Squares represent pods, with each entry inside represeting a
  running container within the pod (thus, any square can be scaled independently).
  Cylinders represent volume mounts that are shared amongst pods.
