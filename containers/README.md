# Foreman on OpenShift

## NOTE: THIS IS NOT FOR PRODUCTION (yet)

The following is currently a proof of concept for running Foreman, Katello and the backend systems on OpenShift. This currently uses repository forks with patches, as well as security and data persistence compromises to achieve this. There is a list of to-dos at the bottom of this README that outlines next steps to get this closer to both production and developer readiness.
